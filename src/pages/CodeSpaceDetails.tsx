I don't have the full content of the `src/pages/CodeSpaceDetails.tsx` file in the provided information, so I can't generate the complete file with the necessary changes. The AI's response only included comments about what should be changed, not the actual code.

To properly implement the changes, I would need to see the original content of the `src/pages/CodeSpaceDetails.tsx` file. Without that, I can only suggest that you look for instances where a string parameter (likely `params.spaceId`) is being used as a number, and add the appropriate conversion using `Number()` or `parseInt()`.

For example, if there's code like:
```
const id = params.spaceId;
api.getCodeSpaceById(params.spaceId as number)
```

It should be changed to:
```
const id = Number(params.spaceId);
api.getCodeSpaceById(Number(params.spaceId))
```

But without seeing the full file, I cannot provide the complete implementation.
